# Safe Flight - Project 3

## Safe Flight is a one-stop platform for travelers looking to book a flight on an airline that is safe, secure and is not prone to malfunctions. 

# Technologies used:

- React
- MySQL
- Node 
- Heroku
- HTML/CSS
- Javascript
- Amadeus Flight API

# How does Safe Flight work?

Users will enter the site and proceed to book a flight as they normally would on other platforms like Kayak, Hopper or Google Flights. They will enter the destination they choose to fly from and the airport they are leaving from. Safe Flight then pulls all available flights that will be flown on secure airlines with no prior issues of malfunction.
